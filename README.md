# qbatch
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A script for generating array and standard jobs in arbitrary chunks to SGE/PBS clusters.
Can also run jobs locally on systems with no batch capability.

```
usage: qbatch [-h] [-w W] [-i] [-c C] [-j J] [-b {pbs,sge}] [--nodes NODES]
              [--ppn PPN] [--highmem] [-n] [--afterok_pattern AFTEROK_PATTERN]
              [--jobname JOBNAME]
              command_file [opts [opts ...]]

Submit commands to a queueing system

positional arguments:
  command_file          An input file containing a list of commands. Use - for
                        STDIN
  opts                  Options to pass directly to qsub (default: None)

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -w W                  Job working directory (default:
                        /data/chamal/projects/gabriel/qbatch)
  -i                    Use individual jobs instead of an array job (default:
                        False)
  -c C                  Number of input lines to chunk into a single job
                        (default: 1)
  -j J                  Number of commands to run in parallel per job
                        (default: 12)
  -b {pbs,sge,local}    Queueing system to use (default: pbs)
  --nodes NODES         Nodes to request per job (default: 1)
  --ppn PPN             Processors per node (ppn on PBS, parallel environment number on SGE) (default: 12)
  --highmem             (Scinet-only) Submit to high memory nodes (default:
                        False)
  -n                    Dry run; nothing is submitted or run (default: False)
  --afterok_pattern AFTEROK_PATTERN
                        Wait for successful completion of job with name(s)
                        matching glob pattern before starting (default: None)
  --jobname JOBNAME     Override default job name generated from command_file,
                        set name for STDIN jobs (default: None)
  --logdir LOGDIR       Directory to save store log files from batch system or
                        local processes (default:
                        your current directory/logs)
```

## Dependencies
qbatch requires at least ``python`` 2.7 and GNU ``parallel`` to run jobs locally.
For Torque/PBS qbatch requires access to ``qsub``, similarly for SGE/SoGE qbatch
requires access to ``qsub``. For Torque/PBS job dependency support the ``pbs_jobnames``
command included in this repository must be found somewhere in the ``$PATH``.


## Environment variable defaults
qbatch supports several environment variables to customize defaults for your
local system

```sh
$ export QBATCH_PPN=12
$ export QBATCH_NODES=1
$ export QBATCH_SYSTEM="pbs"
$ export QBATCH_CORES=$QBATCH_PPN
```

These correspond to the same named options in the qbatch help output above.


## Some examples:
```sh
# Submit an array job from a list of commands (one per line), default settings
$ qbatch commands.txt
# Generates job files in .scripts/, stores logs in logs/

# Submit an array job for SGE
$ qbatch -b sge commands.txt

# set the walltime 
$ qbatch commands.txt -- '#PBS -l walltime=3:00:00'

# Chunk 24 commands per array job
$ qbatch -c24 commands.txt

# Chunk 24 commands per array job, running 12 in parallel
$ qbatch -c25 -j12 commands.txt

# Start jobs after successful completion of all existing jobs with names starting with "2015-11-02-mb_register"
$ qbatch --afterok_pattern '2015-11-02-mb_register*' commands.txt

# Start jobs after successful completion of all existing jobs with names starting with "2015-11-02-mb_register" and "2015-11-02-mb_resample"
$ qbatch --afterok_pattern '2015-11-02-mb_register*' --afterok_pattern '2015-11-02-mb_resample*' commands.txt

# Dynamically generate a list of commands and submit them to batch system
$ for file in /path/to/some/files/*.mnc; echo do_something $file; done | qbatch -N do_something_jobs
# If the loop runs zero times, qbatch will report a warning to STDERR but exit successfully

# Run jobs locally with GNU Parallel, 12 commands in parallel
$ qbatch -b local -j12 commands.txt
# Many options don't make sense locally: chunking, individual vs array, nodes, ppn, highmem, and afterok_pattern are ignored
```
